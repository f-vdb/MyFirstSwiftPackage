# MyFirstSwiftPackage

A description of this package.

My first SwiftPackage test with a xcassets catalog in the package itselfs.
Read the Package.swift file.
And note the bundle: .module argument in the RatingImages.swift model, to get 
the images out of the xcassets catalog.

And these package is grouped in the Orgin Folder/Project.

So i can test and change the package in that project. But the package itself
is located in a extra folder on the same level.

I can read something about it, in my obsidian brain.
